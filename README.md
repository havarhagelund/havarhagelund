# 👋 Hello! I'm Håvar
I'm a full-stack developer with a master's in Computer Science from NTNU, and a few years of hands-on experience building systems, APIs, and integration layers, both as a consultant and in-house. I enjoy solving real problems with code, especially when it makes someone’s workday smoother. I'm curious by nature, thrive in collaborative teams, and believe that good tech is as much about people as it is about code.

Outside of work, you’ll most likely find me chasing fresh air in the mountains, making pizza with friends, or learning something new just for the fun of it.

👷🏻‍♂️ I work at [Frend Digital](https://frend.no) developing tools for SMBs in Norway.

🌱 On the side, I'm developing a project management tool for small-sized construction companies. Check it out [tillow.io](https://tillow.io) and read about how i'm building it [here](https://havar.dev/tillow).

🤔 Always learning! Currently interested in change management and Kotlin development. Read more about my interests at my [site](https://.havar.dev).
